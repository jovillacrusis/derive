## Site 1
https://pathetic.org/poem/1151263655

* What is the URL?

The URL is of a poetry website, particularly a poet from that site.

* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

I found this URL through another poet I was following.

* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

I found this page around 2008/2009 and at that time to me it was a novelty, now that design seems kind of dated but it has not lost its charm to me and in a way enhanced it. Perhaps this is what makes it timeless in my opinion.

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

It is a very simple navigation or interface. The website in general is very dated and even the icons used to create poem folders looks like they are still from geocities. Very simple html format that allows you to edit your poems.

* What parts of the site are interactive?

The poem itself is interactive and invites you to create a poem by "peeking into the woodshed."

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

This particular poem to me is very beautiful, it is interesting because of it being interactive.


* What is one thing you would change about this site?

The colours of the fonts disappear because it does not contrast enough with the background image. I will change the font hierarchy and colours. as well as change the drop down into a more natural looking way that will blend it to the wood textue background.
