## Site 1
https://pathetic.org/poem/1151263655

* What is the URL?

The URL is of a poetry website, particularly a poet from that site.

* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

I found this URL through another poet I was following.

* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

I found this page around 2008/2009 and at that time to me it was a novelty, now that design seems kind of dated but it has not lost its charm to me and in a way enhanced it. Perhaps this is what makes it timeless in my opinion.

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

It is a very simple navigation or interface. The website in general is very dated and even the icons used to create poem folders looks like they are still from geocities. Very simple html format that allows you to edit your poems.

* What parts of the site are interactive?

The poem itself is interactive and invites you to create a poem by "peeking into the woodshed."

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

This particular poem to me is very beautiful, it is interesting because of it being interactive. This website and particular page is significant to me because I used to just post poetry and not care for images or design, it was what made me interested in website design, it took a while for me to decide to post my poems on this site but I had been following and reading poetry from it since 2008/2009.


* What is one thing you would change about this site?

The colours of the fonts disappear because it does not contrast enough with the background image. I will change the font hierarchy and colours. as well as change the drop down into a more natural looking way that will blend it to the wood texture background.

## Site 2

http://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park


* What is the URL?

The URL is from the gallery of an illustrator named Kostas Kiriakis.

* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

 I found this website doing a sort of derive too in tumblr where I subscribed to hashtags for web comics. 

* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

THe design looks typical, as a website portfolio for illustrators. it is a basic html and css website. It has a very user friendly interface and is accomodating of preferences to see the portfolio images either individually or all of them as thumbnails. There are not really any design aspects that will make it trendy. 

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

The navigational system is very symple, the font sizes are on the smallish size but the images are the showcase not so much on the texts. It is a very user friendly interface.

* What parts of the site are interactive?

There  in not much interactiveness or javascript element that I can see, even the front image in the index is a slide using the div element. 

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

The site is rudimentary but the contents are beautiful, particularly his web comics.

* What is one thing you would change about this site?

I would make it more up to date with graphic design and use more interactiveness, specially play off the illustrations with a more interactive and fun interface, maybe avoid scrolling too much for longer content and use javascript or animation to make the web comics interactive.

## Site 3

https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/

* What is the URL?

The URL is for Experimental Jetset it is the website of the famous design group based on Amsterdam.

* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

I found this website as suggested by my instructor for typography ideas because my project last semester for my poster is for an art festival in the Netherlands. So I was looking for Typography ideas for my main image poster. 

* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

The design is very trendy and super simple and minimalist. Experimental jetset believes you need to change conditions to change the consciousness, this idea stems from the materialist perspective of Marx and Engels. So this design company is very innovative and makes their own trends and paves they way for new trends.

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

It is a simple enough navigation system. It does not use the usual link names like "home" or "next", it crosses out pages that are defunct already as it shows on the main page. There is a simple drop down menu for categories which is very helpful.

* What parts of the site are interactive?

There is no interactive aspect although I have not followed all the available links for different campaigns to be sure of this. This website is structured to display different design campaigns and exhibitions, upcoming shows as well.

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

I love the simplicity and minimalism. I love the use of black and white so that when designs have bright colours it is a startling contrast. It is a very interesting website, I can easily spend hours just looking at all the links, campaigns and the links inside the campaigns.

* What is one thing you would change about this site?

Nothing really, I think it loses its overall look and the ambiance that is modern and a bit abstract if it is changed.

## Site 4

http://users.dma.ucla.edu/~rjchang/CrowdsourcedPortraits/index.html

* What is the URL?

The URL is a link in a website by designer/illustrator Rosalind Chang.

I found the website from Are.na while I was checking the contents of "We should talk about this website.

* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

It is a very trendy website, very whimsical. I think some of the design choices interferes with the viewability.

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

The navigation system is simple and is engaging, there is enough vaguenes in it to make the guest want to find out what the link is about, it connects to her other websites and blogs as well. THe particular page that I found charming uses javascripts and highlight the quirkiness of her illustration style and her overall humor.

* What parts of the site are interactive?

The crowdsourcing link above is interactive and make the guest click on various illustration heads to read a text or quote.

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

The site is very funny and engaging, her photography and designs are very beautiful.

* What is one thing you would change about this site?

THe index page makes me squint, maybe a better color option.

## Site 5

http://blacknegative.com/#!/whoweare/

* What is the URL?

The URL is for an advertising company based in Paris.

* How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc?

I google searched interactive websites, one article has a list of websites that has "black negative" in it.

* How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way?

The design is very current, trendy, and is a very interactive interface which has a lot of motion graphics, animations, videos in it.

* Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?

It ia a fairly uncommon navigation system that invites you to drag the pages to see different campaigns, in each campaign there are lots of interactive elements that you can click or drag to watch a video, animation, listen to audio or know more about said campaign.

* What parts of the site are interactive?

All parts of the site is fair to say are interactive.

* How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful?

It is very beautiful and uses a lot of audio that is ethereal, it appeals to me and you can see why they are a successful advertising company just by their website. Because of the interactive element it is very interesting to browse.

* What is one thing you would change about this site?

I wish it would have been more straightforward about what it is, who they are, but I'm, guessing the vagueness makes the guests try to go through all of the pages to go to the sort of index page, so this is a device itself to make you stay and learn more.
